Here‚Äôs a simple way to practice:
# Basic Usage: 
### Try searching for a word in a file:

```commandline
grep "search_term" filename.txt
```

- Case-Insensitive Search: Use -i to ignore case sensitivity:
```commandline
grep -i "search_term" filename.txt
```
- Search Recursively in Directories: Use -r to search in all files within a directory:
```commandline
grep -r "search_term" /path/to/directory
```
- Show Line Numbers: Use -n to display the line number:
```commandline
grep -n "search_term" filename.txt
```
- Search for Whole Words Only: Use -w to match whole words:
```commandline
grep -w "word" filename.txt
```
- Exclude Lines Matching a Pattern: Use -v to invert the match:
```commandline
grep -v "unwanted_term" filename.txt
```
